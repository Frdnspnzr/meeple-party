It's about boardgames! On Meeple Party you can connect with your friends, browse their game collections and simply mark every game you want to play. Meeple Party then does the work of looking through all your friend's collections and what they want to play to tell you what everybody's up for. Don't worry, if you already have your collection on BoardGameGeek you can import it.

If you just want to use Meeple Party go to [https://meeple.party](https://meeple.party/) and create an account. It's the instance hosted by me, the developer, and free for all.

If you want to host your own instance of Meeple Party go ahead! It's a Next.JS application and they have [extensive documentation on deploying](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying). You will still need some infrastructure though. See the [Hosting Meeple Party yourself](https://github.com/Friedenspanzer/meeple-party/wiki/Hosting-Meeple-Party-yourself) section in the Wiki.

## Goals

Meeple Party was created after I found out a friend of mine owned a game I was dying to play for literal years. I have never checked out his whole shelve and I never brought it up in conversation. We both however had the necessary information in our BoardGameGeek accounts: The game was in his collection as Owned and in my collection as Want To Play.

So I asked myself why we weren't just presented with this information. And that was the basic idea of Meeple Party. The base functionality does nothing but check my whole circle of friends for games somebody owns and enough people want to play to get it going and just ... tells me. Without any further work, without checking everybodys profile, without asking in countless group chats about every game I'd like to play.

I don't want Meeple Party to become *Yet another social network but it's about board games*. I have Mastodon, BoardGameGeek, Reddit and [Unknowns](https://unknowns.de/) to talk to strangers about board games and I really enjoy it most of the times. So Meeple Party should just be about me and my friends and empower us to get games to the table we would have otherwise missed. Every feature added should add to this simple goal.
