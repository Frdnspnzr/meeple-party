Meeple Party now supports uploading an avatar right on site!
Your Avatar will still be loaded from the profile you used to login by default but after that you can change it anytime you want.

There are some limits in place for the avatars:

- Only files allowed are JPG and PNG. Sorry, no animated avatars!
- No files over 1MB. That's pretty generous for a small avatar, though.

Our content rules obviously apply to avatars. Don't be a wangrod.
