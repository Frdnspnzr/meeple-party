Das ist die beste Erfindung seit geschnittenem Brot! Meeple Party is now translateable and I provided a German translation. You can change the page language in your settings.

As always there's still some outstanding issues:

- The auto detection does not work. So for users choosing that in their profile and users that are not logged in the page is always shown in English.
- The game names are still only shown in English as the BoardGameGeek API seems to â€¦ act a bit difficult regarding translated game names.

I you feel you could help with any of that and can spare the time I'd be happy if you [got involved](https://github.com/Frdnspnzr/meeple-party/issues/94)!

And while we're at it, if you'd like to see Meeple Party in your native language I'd appreciate the help, too! If you know how to do stuff like that [here's](https://github.com/Frdnspnzr/meeple-party/blob/main/i18n/locales) the translation files, just open a pull request for your translations. If you're not that technically inclined but still want to help let me know and I will help you as best as I can. You can do so [via e-mail](mailto:contact@meeple.party), [on Mastodon](https://brettspiel.space/@meepleparty) or using the still pretty empty [Meeple Party Discord server](https://discord.gg/x9R46w4SME).
