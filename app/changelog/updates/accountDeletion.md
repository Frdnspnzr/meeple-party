We're sad to see you go but we're absolutely sure that you should have the last say about your data. So from now on users are empowered to just delete everything Meeple Party knows about them with a single click. And then another click for confirmation. And then some typing just to be sure. But you get the gist.

The delete feature is available in the user menu under Settings. It's currently pretty empty there but surely that menu will fill up in no time.

Deletion will delete _everything_. Right now that's basically just your collection and friends list but in the future that will mean every last bit of data that every feature currently planned or unplanned will ever create. Everything will be purged, never to return. Because that's just polite.
